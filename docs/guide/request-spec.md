## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why not use form data submissions?

Form data submissions have two main drawbacks:

1. Limited format: data can only be submitted as strings.
2. Nested data limitations: complex nested data structures can lead to excessively large submissions.

### Why not use RESTful or GraphQL APIs?

RESTful APIs require a deeper understanding of verbs and nouns for developers.

GraphQL, while powerful, involves complex parsing and authorization processes. Utilizing frameworks like Apollo can be cumbersome within a FaaS environment.

Therefore, FaasJS adopts a simplified approach, combining the clarity of RESTful with the flexibility of GraphQL.

Requests are defined solely using `action` and `params`.
